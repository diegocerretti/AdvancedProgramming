You can use function `value()` to evaluate any expression involving the variables in the optimal solution. If you need many variables, it might be good to introduce them using an array of their names using `dicts()` method and use the returned dictionary to access them.\n",

The monarch of the island would like to inspect validity of each of these contracts during a single large event. The monarch requires two representatives to represent each contract relationship (they can be both from the same party of the contract or each from a different one). This is of course satisfied by each company sending a single representative, which would require involvement of 69 representatives in total. However, the companies want to find a solution which minimizes the total number of representatives who need to attend the event.\n",
