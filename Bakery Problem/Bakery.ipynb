        "Consider a small bakery with a single oven. It needs to schedule baking of n pastries, each of them having three requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "time when the preparations are done and pastry is ready for baking\n",
        "time needed for baking, i.e., for how long should it remain in the oven\n",
        "deadline: time when the custommer comes to pick up the pastry\n",
        "At each moment, only one kind of pastry can be present in the oven.\n",
        "Use an ILP to find a shortest baking schedule. Schedule, in this context, is a set of starting times s1, ..., sn denoting when should each pastry be put into oven. Note: these times need not be integral. However, integral variables will be useful to enforce that the periods when two different kinds of pastries are in the oven do not overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us denote $e_1$, ..., $e_n$ the ending times of baking of each of the pastries, i.e., $e_i = s_i + baking time of pastry_i$. We need to make sure that for each two pastries $i,j$, one of the following needs to be true: $e_i ≤ s_j$ or $e_j ≤ s_i$. Obviously, they cannot hold at the same time and it depends on the precedence between i and j which one is true. Since we do not know the precedence in advance, which of these constraints should we include in the LP?\n",
        "\n",
        "###Big-M method\n",
        "This name usually refers to an alternative way how to start the simplex method without knowledge of the initial basic feasible solution. We did not cover this in the class and I do not go into details of this here either. But the other meaning of Big-M is a method for switching someof the constraints on/off depending on the value of some binary variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine, we have variable x which should be bounded by $10$ if and only if some binary variable $z$ is set to zero. Also, assume that there is no reason to increase x beyound some large number $M$ (e.g., because we are minimizing over $x$, or we know that no feasible solution can have $x > M$ for some other reasons). Then, we can write $x ≤ 10 + Mz$: if $z$ is $0$, this switches the constraint ON. If $z=1$, this constraint evaluates to $x ≤ 10 + M$ which, by choice of $M$ is satisfied by any reasonable solution to our LP and this effectively switches the costraint OFF. Usually, due to possible numerical issues, it is recommended to use $M$ as small as possible. You can check the following blog for more discussion of big-M: https://orinanobworld.blogspot.com/2011/07/perils-of-big-m.html.\n",

        "Use library matplotlib to visualize your solution suitably. I leave to your creativity how to do it, but it should be clear what are the moments when oven needs to be open, what pastry goes out and what should be put in. There are many other things to visualize: expected arrivals of custommers and times when each pastry is ready, critical preparations (which pastry needs special care to be prepared on time, otherwise it would delay the whole schedule, etc). The main criterion for evaluation of this will be clarity and information it provides.\n",
